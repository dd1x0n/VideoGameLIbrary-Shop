#Video Game Console Sales/Storefront app & Collection Databse

This program allows users to enter systems they are interested in purchasing or selling, Game Collection Database. My goal was to allow a quick and easy way to reccomend a random game from an external source that can be applied by anyone who has data posted in a raw file online. 

This is a console application that works as a storefront to check out/sell consoles, access external text file of current collection and a wishlist system. This project uses a variety of .NET services. 

Follow the prompts after compiling to execute the program. To run, navigate to Program.cs in the VGShopConsoleApp folder. The repo is located at https://github.com/dd1x0n/VideoGameLIbrary-Shop/tree/master 


Optional Requiremnts Used in Program:
1.) "Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program." - This program allows users to enter data in order to sell multiple video game consoles and checkpout with final price. Users can choose all or a single item in the cart. 

2.) & 3. ) "Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. / Create another class which inherits one or more properties from its parent." - This option is fullfilled thought the program particualrly in the checkout stage of the program. Data population comes from an eternal pasebin file wich is then manipulated and a .csv wishlist. 

4.) "Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your
application" -  Program reads from two sourses, Patebin and wishlist.csv. 

5.) "Create a call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used in your application" - used in checkout stage of application. 

WARNING: Two sets files outside of the main program are referenced so make sure that is implemented in your IDE. This was built with Visual Studio for Mac.
